                implementing a patient's medical or nursing care plan

                furnished by the provider without discrimination, in
                accordance with section 104(a). Nothing in this
                subparagraph shall be construed as requiring the
                provision of a type or class of items or services that
                are outside the scope of the provider's normal
                practice.

                individual for any covered items or services other than

                            (i) quality review by designated entities;
                            (ii) making payments under this Act,
                        including the examination of records as may be

                        may specify.
                    (D) In the case of a provider that is not an

                for the provision of health services any individual or
                other provider that has had a participation agreement
                under this subsection terminated for cause. The
                Secretary may authorize such employment or use on a
                case-by-case basis.
                    (E) In the case of a provider paid under a fee-for-
                service basis for items and services furnished under
                this Act, the provider agrees to submit bills and any
                required supporting documentation relating to the
                provision of covered items and services within 30 days
                after the date of providing such items and services.
                    (F) In the case of an institutional provider paid

                        with respect to specific individuals.
                    (G) In the case of a provider that receives payment
                for items and services furnished under this Act based
                on diagnosis-related coding, procedure coding, or other
                coding system or data, the provider agrees--
                            (i) to disclose to the Secretary any system
                        or index of coding or classifying patient
                        symptoms, diagnoses, clinical interventions,
                        episodes, or procedures that such provider
                        utilizes for global budget negotiations under
                        title VI or for meeting any other payment,
                        documentation, or data collection requirements
                        under this Act; and
                            (ii) not to use any such system or index to

                        for health care professionals, or that is
                        proprietary, interferes with the medical or
                        nursing process, or is designed to increase the
                        amount or number of payments.
                    (H) The provider complies with the duty of provider
                ethics and reporting requirements described in
                paragraph (2).
                    (I) In the case of a provider that is not an
                individual, the provider agrees that no board member,
                executive, or administrator of such provider receives
                compensation from, owns stock or has other financial
                investments in, or serves as a board member of any

        shall--
                    (A) promulgate reasonable reporting rules to

                compensation based on patient utilization or based on
                financial outcomes of any other provider or entity; and
                    (C) prohibit participating providers or any board
                member or representative of such provider from serving
                as board members for or receiving any compensation,
                stock, or other financial investment in an entity that
                contracts with or provides items or services (including
                pharmaceutical products and medical devices or
                equipment) to such provider.

                            (i) by the Secretary for failure to meet
                        the requirements of this Act;
                            (ii) in accordance with the provisions

        region and shall ensure that such entities do not provide
        financial incentives to reviewers to favor one pattern of
        practice over another. The Center shall ensure coordination and
        reporting by such entities to ensure national consistency in
        quality standards.
            (5) Submission of a report to the Secretary annually
        specifically on findings from outcomes research and development
        of practice guidelines that may affect the Secretary's

                evaluating data on health care disparities on the basis
                of race, ethnicity, national origin, primary language
                use, age, disability, sex (including gender identity

                strategies and approaches to reporting quality
                measures, as appropriate, on the basis of race,
                ethnicity, national origin, primary language use, age,
                disability, sex (including gender identity and sexual
                orientation), geography, or socioeconomic status.

eliminate profit from the provision of health care.
    (b) Prohibitions.--Payments to providers under this Act may not

                        cost.
                            (iv) The relationship between the price of
                        such drug, including compensation payments, and
                        the health benefits of such drug.
                            (v) Other relevant factors determined
                        appropriate by the Secretary to provide
                        reasonable compensation.

                prices available, during the most recent 12-month
                period for which data is available prior to the
                beginning of such negotiated price period, from the

        implementation of a competitive license or run contrary to
        public policy.
            (6) Required reporting.--The Secretary may require
        pharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose to the Secretary such
