Consistent with subsection (f), a depository institution that redeems a payment stablecoin issued by a depository institution in receivership shall be considered to have a valid claim, with corresponding priority under this subsection, on a payment stablecoin issued by the institution in receivership.

&nbsp;

# TITLE VII—RESPONSIBLE BANKING INNOVATION

## SEC. 701. STUDY ON USE OF DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY FOR REDUCTION OF RISK IN DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall complete a study and submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report regarding the manner in which distributed ledger technology may reduce risk for depository institutions, as defined in section 19(b)(1) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)), including settlement risk, operational risk and capital requirements.

&nbsp;

## SEC. 702. ELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL RESERVE SERVICES TO DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:

(1) Final settlement of transactions in central bank money reduces risk in the financial system, including through the reduction of counterparty exposure.

(2) Digital assets settle with finality in seconds or minutes, whereas traditional financial transactions may take days to settle.

(3) This mismatch in the settlement window of digital assets and traditional financial assets creates risk in the economy that may be reduced through the ability of depository institutions to simultaneously conduct digital asset transactions and settle, with finality, the United States dollar component of these transactions.

(4) The Federal Reserve Act specifies that a depository institution, as defined in section 19(b)(1) of that Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)), upon receiving a charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, National Credit Union Administration or State bank supervisor, is required to be made available services from Federal Reserve banks under section 11A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 248a), including currency and coin services, wire transfer services, automated clearinghouse services and settlement services.

(5) Numerous Federal courts have found that the provision of services to depository institutions under section 11A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 248a) is a ministerial duty imposed by Congress with respect to all depository institutions.

(6) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has long interpreted the Federal Reserve Act to mean that the Federal Reserve banks must provide services to all depository institutions, noting that it has a duty "to ensure the provision of payment services to all depository institutions on an equitable basis, and to do so in an atmosphere of competitive fairness".

(7) The Federal Reserve banks have, on occasion, provided services to non-depository, non-insured institutions without appropriate statutory authority.

(8) Certain novel legal positions that conflict with or frustrate these precedents are not in the best traditions of the Federal Reserve Act, our dual banking system, and the imperatives of Congress.

(9) The statutory independence of the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve banks under the Constitution of the United States is properly rooted in absolute fidelity to the laws enacted by Congress.

(10) It is appropriate for Congress to reaffirm its existing statutory intent to ensure that all depository institutions may access services under the Federal Reserve Act "on an equitable basis, and to do so in an atmosphere of competitive fairness".

(b) Pricing of Services.—Section 11A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 248a) is amended by adding at the end the following:

"(f) A Federal Reserve bank shall provide a segregated balance account to a depository institution upon the request of any institution that receives services under this section.".

(c) Deposits; Exchange and Collection; Member and Nonmember Banks or Other Depository Institutions; Charges.—Section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 342) is amended to read as follows:

"Any Federal Reserve bank shall receive from any of its member banks or other depository institutions, and from the United States, deposits of current funds in lawful money, national-bank notes, Federal reserve notes, or checks, and drafts, payable upon presentation or other items, and also, for collection, maturing notes and bills; or, solely for purposes of exchange or of collection, shall receive from other Federal Reserve banks deposits of current funds in lawful money, national-bank notes, or checks upon other Federal Reserve banks, and checks and drafts, payable upon presentation within its district or other items, and maturing notes and bills payable within its district; or, solely for the purposes of exchange or of collection, shall receive from any non-member bank or trust company or other depository institution deposits of current funds in lawful money, national-bank notes, Federal reserve notes, checks and drafts payable upon presentation or other items, or maturing notes and bills: Provided, Such nonmember bank or trust company or other depository institutions maintains with the Federal Reserve bank of its district a balance in such amount as the Board determines taking into account items in transit, services provided by the Federal Reserve bank, and other factors as the Board may deem appropriate: Provided further, That nothing in this or any other section of this Act shall be construed as prohibiting a member or nonmember bank or other depository institution from making reasonable charges, to be determined and regulated by the Board of Governors, but in no case to exceed 10 cents per $100 or fraction thereof, based on the total of checks and drafts presented at any one time, for collection or payment of checks and drafts and remission therefor by exchange or otherwise; but no such charges shall be made against the Federal Reserve banks.".

&nbsp;

## SEC. 703. ROUTING TRANSIT NUMBER ISSUANCE.

Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall assume responsibility for issuing routing transit numbers to depository institutions for all purposes relating to the clearing of transactions and the services required to be made available to all depository institutions under section 11A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 248a).

&nbsp;

## SEC. 704. CLARIFYING APPLICATION REVIEW TIMES WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES.

Section 343 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4807) is amended by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:

"(a) Final Action.—

"(1) Definition.—In this subsection, the term ‘completed application’—

"(A) means the information requested by the Federal banking agency at the outset of an application through application forms or similar means; and

"(B) does not include supplemental information requested by the agency after filing of an application.

"(1) shall disclose the reason why the application has not yet been approved or denied by the Federal banking agency; and

"(2) shall not contain confidential supervisory information.".

&nbsp;

## SEC. 705. EXAMINATION STANDARDS FOR DIGITAL ASSET ACTIVITIES.

&nbsp;

## SEC. 706. ASSET CUSTODY FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER ENTITIES.

(a) Findings.—Congress finds the following:

(1) The laws surrounding custody of financial assets is largely customary, uncodified, and poorly understood.

(2) Lack of uniformity amongst various jurisdictions’ laws relating to custody has largely not been addressed by regulators, can contribute to risk, and is producing uncertainty for innovators.

(3) Codifying basic principles around custody of financial assets will reduce systemic risk, clearly define the rights and duties of both custodian and customer, and contribute to a more uniform and effective banking system.

(b) Definition.—In this section, the term "custody" means the safekeeping, servicing and management of customer financial assets, including currency, securities and commodities, on an off-balance sheet basis.

(c) Custody.—

(1) In general.—Except as provided in paragraph (2), custody of financial assets is accomplished by a bailment and established by a written customer agreement. Custody shall not be a fiduciary or trust activity unless the custodian is providing substantial discretionary services with respect to an account, including through investment advice or investment discretion, and the custodian owes a customer a higher standard of care or duty with respect to the customer of that account.

(2) Exception.—A custodian and customer may establish a legal relationship other than a bailment pursuant to a written customer agreement.

(d) Proper Documentation.—A custodial account shall be properly documented in a customer agreement, with a clearly defined legal relationship between the custodian and customer. Custodial assets shall be properly identified and segregated from the assets of the custodian, with proper documentation of asset segregation.

(e) Not Assets or Liabilities.—Assets properly held in a custodial account under this section are not assets or liabilities of the custodian and shall be maintained on an off-balance sheet basis, including for the purpose of accounting treatment for the custodian and the customers of the custodian, notwithstanding the form in which the assets are maintained.

(f) Applicability.—This section shall apply to depository institutions, as defined in section 19(b)(1) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)), and non-depository trust companies chartered under section 5169 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 27).

&nbsp;

## SEC. 707. REPUTATION RISK; REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCOUNT TERMINATION REQUESTS AND ORDERS.

(e) Customer Notice.—

(1) Notice required.—Except as provided under paragraph (2) or as otherwise prohibited from being disclosed by law, if an appropriate Federal banking agency orders a depository institution to terminate a specific customer account or a group of customer accounts, the depository institution shall inform the specific customer or group of customers of the justification for the customer’s account termination described under subsection (b).

(2) Notice prohibited.—

(A) Notice prohibited in cases of national security.—If an appropriate Federal banking agency requests or orders a depository institution to terminate a specific customer account or a group of customer accounts based on a belief that the customer or customers pose a threat to national security, or are otherwise described under subsection (a)(2), neither the depository institution nor the appropriate Federal banking agency may inform the customer or customers of the justification for the customer’s account termination.

(B) Notice prohibited in other cases.—If an appropriate Federal banking agency determines that the notice required under paragraph (1) may interfere with an authorized criminal investigation, neither the depository institution nor the appropriate Federal banking agency may inform the specific customer or group of customers of the justification for the customer’s account termination.

(1) the aggregate number of specific customer accounts that the agency requested or ordered a depository institution to terminate during the previous year; and
