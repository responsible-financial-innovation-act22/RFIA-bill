description: >
  Tegra194 has two PHY bricks namely HSIO (High Speed IO) and NVHS (NVIDIA High
  Speed) each interfacing with 12 and 8 P2U instances respectively.
  A P2U instance is a glue logic between Synopsys DesignWare Core PCIe IP's PIPE
  interface and PHY of HSIO/NVHS bricks. Each P2U instance represents one PCIe
  lane.
