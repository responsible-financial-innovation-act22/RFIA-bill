/**
 * DOC: cxl mem
 *
 * CXL memory endpoint devices and switches are CXL capable devices that are
 * participating in CXL.mem protocol. Their functionality builds on top of the
 * CXL.io protocol that allows enumerating and configuring components via
 * standard PCI mechanisms.
 *
 * The cxl_mem driver owns kicking off the enumeration of this CXL.mem
 * capability. With the detection of a CXL capable endpoint, the driver will
 * walk up to find the platform specific port it is connected to, and determine
 * if there are intervening switches in the path. If there are switches, a
 * secondary action is to enumerate those (implemented in cxl_core). Finally the
 * cxl_mem driver adds the device it is bound to as a CXL endpoint-port for use
 * in higher level operations.
